# A load test for Jmeter task

 
I built this project on Windows, so installation method also should be for Windows.
Next steps help you to perform the load test
 
  Let's do it!


## Install Java
JMeter is a pure Java application and should run correctly on any system that has a compatible Java implementation.
Download [Java Platform (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

After installation is finished, you can use the following procedure to check whether Java JDK is installed successfully in your system

-   In Window/Linux, go to `Terminal`
-   Enter command `java -version`

If the Java runtime environment is installed successfully, you will see a relevant program version.


 
## Install Jmeter

You can download last version [here](http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi). This project was implimented on version 5.2.

Next, you should simply unzip the file into the directory where you want JMeter to be installed. 

Simply unzip and you are done!
